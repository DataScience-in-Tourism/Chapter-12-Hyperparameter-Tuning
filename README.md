### Abstract

Hyperparameter tuning is one of the most important steps in the machine learning pipeline and can turn an apparently unsuccessful model into a solid business solution by finding the right combination of input values. As part of this notebooks, will be laid out the theoretical foundations behind different traditional approaches to optimizing hyperparameters such as Manual Search, Grid Search and Random Search. Additionally, more advanced informed search techniques such as Bayesian Optimization and Genetic Algorithms are going to be outlined. Alongside with theoretical explanations, a practical example application in the tourism industry including Python code is going to be provided. 

### Environment Setup

This notebooks were created using `Python 3.6`.  To set-up your local environment run in terminal the commands below:

```bash
# Clone the repository.

# (Windows Optional) Create a new Python environment and activate it.
python -m venv .env
.env\Scripts\activate

# (Ubuntu Optional) Create a new Python environment and activate it.
python3 -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate

# Install the dependencies.
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Use your preferred IDE in order to run the notebooks
```
